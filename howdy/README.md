This is my final project for CS50,
a website called Howdy made with javascript, react,
next.js and firebase.

# intro

    My Howdy website is a place where you con publish your thougths at any time
people can see them and comment and even if they are inspired they can
register and make their own posts and comment on yours to thank You
for the inspiration.

    In the the great scheme of things You may think a lot of things, but what
happends if You said the wrong thing or expressed yourself in a desirable way
well don't worry, Howdy offers you the fantastic opportunity of editing your
post to let you be the person you decide to be.

    Enter the magical world of howdy so You can make your ideas a reality.

# Tools of choice (javascript, react, firebase)

    Howdy was made with javascript since it's a language that i'm very
familiar with and it's just really comfortable. I also used React and Next
to optimize the design and functionality of the website. Granting me better design
posibilities to get the best out of my idea.

    This frameworks were an excellent choice to work with since they were very
comfortable and just helped me a lot with all the heavylifting. All the libraries
at first were overwhelming but when I understood them it was like being able to do
anything UNLIMITED POWEEER

    Since Howdy's basically a CRUD app I needed to use a database that i could trust,
and you'd think that i'd use SQL but since working with javascript and and react the best
option that came to the table was Firebase, working with it was a total charm and i'll
definetly keep working with it.

# Usage

    To run Howdy you must run the command "project/ $ npm run dev". As you can see it
must be done from the project folder. You go to the localhost diplayed on the terminal
and by accesing it you'll get to the homepage

    In Howdy you'll first have to join in making an account with google authentitation.
With your account ready you'll be able to make posts by pressing the "New Post" button.
By doing so it'll take you to the write secction where you can start writing. It has
a limit of only 300 character. By pressing submit your post will be desplayed at "The wall:"
You can comment your own post or other people's by pressing the comments button. As you
can see, it displays the amount of comments that the post has. By pressing your profile picture
on the navbar it'll take you to your dashboard where you can see all of your posts and give
you the chance to edit them or delete them. It also displays the "Log out" button to log out
of your Howdy session by keeping your user and posts on the Howdy database so you can log in again
and have all of your and other people's posts.

# Motivation

    When thinking about my project ideas it really grabbed my attention making a CRUD app
since i knew it would test my skills on the backend side of the development, I was already
pretty familiarized with the frontend so I wanted to learn new things.

    My idea for Howdy basically came from the idea of ideas themself, thoughts that come to you
suddenly or with effort. I just really wanted to make like a website to post thoughts. Later it
came the idea of letting people comment. I really liked working on Howdy and the end result that
it ended up being.

    CS50 was definetly and incredible ride. I have to thank the professors for everything. But specially
for motivating me to learn more each day with joy and passion for this magical world of computer science
